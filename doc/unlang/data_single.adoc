== Single Quoted Strings

'string'

A single quoted string is interpreted without any dynamic string
expansion. The quotes allow the string to contain spaces, which are not
allowed in the `word` form described in the previous section. The single
quote character can be placed in such a string by escaping it with a
backslash.

*Examples:*

`'hello'` +
`'foo bar`' +
`'foo\\'bar'` +
`'this is a long string'`
