== Simple Words

*Examples:*

`Hello` +
`User-Name`

Where a series of characters cannot be parsed as a decimal number,
they are interpreted as a simple string composed of one word. These
words are interpreted as static strings and are usually equivalent to
placing the string in single quotes. When they are used in the left-hand
side of a conditional expression they can be interpreted as a reference
to an attribute.

This syntax is allowed for simplicity, as there are many cases where
simple text can be used, and it would be awkward to require the simple
text to be quoted.
