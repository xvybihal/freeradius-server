use the typical `%{...}` format.  Instead, they are short-cuts for
simple, common cases.

* `%%` +

 - Returns `%`.

* `%d` +

 - Two-digit day of the month when the request was received.

* `%l` +

 - The Unix timestamp of when the request was received. This is an
unsigned decimal number. It should be used with time-based calculations.

* `%m` +

 - Two-digit month describing when the request was received.

* `%t` +

 - Timestamp in _ctime_ format.

* `%D` +

 - Request date (YYYYMMDD)

* `%H` +

 - Two digit hour of the day describing when the request was received.

* `%S` +

 - Request timestamp in SQL format, YYYY-mmm-ddd HH:MM:SS

* `%T` +

 - Request timestamp in database format, YYYY-mmm-ddd HH.MM.SS.000000

* `%Y` +

 - Four digit request year.
