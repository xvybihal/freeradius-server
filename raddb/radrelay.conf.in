#  = Radrelay Configuration
#
#  Use with:
#
#      radiusd -n radrelay
#
#  This file is a sample configuration that replaces the old
#  `radrelay` program.  It is a _minimal_ configuration that
#  does little more than read the `detail` file, and proxy the
#  packets to a home server.  If you need it to do more than
#  just replace `radrelay`, you will need to add additional
#  configuration.
#
#  See `raddb/sites-available/copy-acct-to-home-server` for a
#  more complete example.  That example is intended to be run
#  as part of a larger RADIUS configuration, where the server
#  also listens on ports 1812, etc.  The example given here
#  is a minimal example that has *only* `radrelay` functionality.
#
#  See `radiusd.conf` for a complete description of the configuration
#  parameters used here.
#

#
#  ## General definitions
#
#  The following options define where the server files are stored
#  when installed. They are set by 'make' at compile time, and it
#  is unlikely to need to change them.
#
prefix = @prefix@
exec_prefix = @exec_prefix@
sysconfdir = @sysconfdir@
localstatedir = @localstatedir@
sbindir = @sbindir@
logdir = @logdir@
raddbdir = @raddbdir@
radacctdir = @radacctdir@

#
#  name:: This is the name of the running server.
#
#  See also the `-n` command-line option.
#
name = radrelay

#
#  Location of config and logfiles.
#
confdir = ${raddbdir}
run_dir = ${localstatedir}/run/${name}
libdir = @libdir@
pidfile = ${run_dir}/${name}.pid

#
#  max_request_time::
#  cleanup_delay::
#
#  Request handling configuration.
#
max_request_time = 30
cleanup_delay = 5

#
#  ## Logging configuration
#
#  The following section defines global server logging options.
#  For more configurable and detailed logging, the logging modules
#  should be used (`rlm_detail`, `rlm_linelog` etc.)
#
log {
	#
	#  destination: Destination for log messages.
	#
	#  This can be one of:
	#
	#  |===
	#  | Destination | Description
	#  | files       | Log to `file`, as defined below.
	#  | syslog      | To syslog (see also the `syslog_facility`, below.
	#  | stdout      | Standard output.
	#  | stderr      | Standard error.
	#  |===
	#
	#  The command-line option `-X` over-rides this option, and forces
	#  logging to go to stdout.
	#
	destination = files

	#
	#  file:: The logging messages for the server are appended to the
	#  tail of this file `if ${destination} == "files"`
	#
	#  NOTE: If the server is running in debugging mode, this file is
	#  NOT used.
	#
	file = ${logdir}/${name}.log
}

#
#  .SECURITY CONFIGURATION
#
#  There may be multiple methods of attacking on the server.  This
#  section holds the configuration items which minimize the impact
#  of those attacks
#
security {
	#
	#  max_attributes:: The maximum number of attributes
	#  permitted in a RADIUS packet.  Packets which have MORE
	#  than this number of attributes in them will be dropped.
	#
	#  If this number is set too low, then no RADIUS packets
	#  will be accepted.
	#
	#  If this number is set too high, then an attacker may be
	#  able to send a small number of packets which will cause
	#  the server to use all available memory on the machine.
	#
	#  Setting this number to 0 means "allow any number of attributes"
	#
	max_attributes = 200

	#
	# reject_delay && status_server don't apply when we are
	# only reading accounting packets from the detail file
	#

@openssl_version_check_config@
}

#
#  ## Modules
#
#  If you need more modules, add them here. The `radrelay`
#  configuration is very simple, and only includes one module.
#
modules {
	$INCLUDE ${confdir}/mods-enabled/always
}

#
#  If you need to instantiate modules, add them here.
#
instantiate {
}

#
#  ## Home server configuration
#
#  The relay functionality requires proxying to be enabled.
#
proxy_requests  = yes

#
#  Define a `home server`, which is where packets should be
#  relayed to.
#
home_server home1 {
	#
	#  type::
	#
	type = acct

	#
	#  ipaddr:: This directive replaces the `-r` command-line option
	#  in `radrelay`.
	#
	ipaddr = 192.0.2.20

	#
	#  port::
	#
	port = 1812

	#
	#  src_ipaddr:: This directive replaces the `-i` command-line option
	#  in `radrelay`.
	#
#	src_ipaddr = 192.0.2.1

	#
	#  secret:: This directive replaces the `-s`, `-S`, and `-n` command-line
	#  options in `radrelay`.
	#
	secret = testing123
}

#
#  List one or more home servers here for fail-over,
#  load-balancing, etc. By default we just send all relayed
#  packets to the one home server, `home1`, defined above.
#
home_server_pool radrelay {
	type = fail-over
	home_server = home1
}

#
#  Create a dummy realm that relays to the above server pool.
#
realm radrelay {
	acct_pool = radrelay
}

#
#  ## Server configuration
#
#  We now define a virtual server to read RADIUS packets from a
#  'detail' file, and proxy them to the dummy realm above.
#
server radrelay {
	#
	#  Read the detail file:
	#
	listen {
		#
		#  type::
		#
		type = detail

		#
		#  filename:: The filename here should be the same as the one used by the
		#  main `radiusd` program.
		#
		#  It writes the file using the `detail` module (see `raddb/modules/detail`).
		#
		filename = ${radacctdir}/detail

		#
		#  load_factor::
		#
		load_factor = 90
	}

	#
	#  This section is called when the server receives an
	#  Accounting-Request packet (which will be from the
	#  "detail" reader above.
	#
	#  See also `raddb/sites-available/copy-acct-to-home-server`
	#  for additional description.
	#
	recv Accounting-Request {
		#
		#  Proxy the packet using the given realm.
		#  Note that we do not use the realm for anything else such
		#  as prefix/suffix stripping, or comparisons.
		#
		update control {
			Proxy-To-Realm := "radrelay"
		}
	}
}
